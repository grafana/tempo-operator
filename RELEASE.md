# Release instructions

Steps to release a new version of the Tempo Operator:

1. Change the images tags to corresponding versions on `config/manager/controller_manager_config.yaml` the operator is usually aligned with the tempo versions. 
3. Run `make bundle USER=os-observability OPERATOR_VERSION=x.y.z`, where `x.y.z` is the version that will be released.
5. Add the changes to the changelog, see Generating the changelog secction.
6. Send a PR with the changes
7. Once the changes above are merged and available in `main`, tag it with the desired version, prefixed with `v`: `vx.y.z`
8. The GitHub Workflow will take it from here, creating a GitHub release with the generated artifacts (manifests) and publishing the images
9. After the release, generate a new OLM bundle (`make bundle`) and create two PRs against the `Community Operators repositories`:
   1. one for the `community-operators-prod`, used by OLM on Kubernetes. Example: [`operator-framework/community-operators-prod`](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod/pull/494)
   1. one for the `community-operators` directory, used by Operatorhub.io. Example: [`operator-framework/community-operators`](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators/pull/461)

## Generating the changelog

We use the chloggen to generate the changelog, simply run the following to generate the Changelog:

```bash
OPERATOR_VERSION=x.y.z make chlog-update
```

This will delete all entries (other than the template) in the `.chloggen` directory and create a populated Changelog.md entry.
