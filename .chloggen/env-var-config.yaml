  The operator no longer uses a ConfigMap-based configuration file. All configuration is now
  managed through code defaults and environment variable overrides. This change:

  - Removes controller_manager_config.yaml from community and OpenShift overlays
  - Moves all community defaults into DefaultProjectConfig() in the codebase
  - Configures OpenShift-specific settings via environment variables in the deployment

  Environment variables take precedence over code defaults, enabling OLM Subscription
  config overrides without modifying the operator deployment directly.

  Boolean feature gates are configured via a single FEATURE_GATES environment variable with comma-separated values:
  - Format: "gate1,gate2,-gate3" where - prefix disables the gate
  - Available gates: openshift.route, openshift.servingCertsService, openshift.oauthProxy, httpEncryption,
    grpcEncryption, prometheusOperator, grafanaOperator, observability.metrics.createServiceMonitors,
    observability.metrics.createPrometheusRules, networkPolicies, builtInCertManagement

  Non-boolean settings use individual environment variables:
  - DISTRIBUTION, OPENSHIFT_BASE_DOMAIN, TLS_PROFILE, DEFAULT_POD_SECURITY_CONTEXT
  - BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CA_VALIDITY, BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CA_REFRESH,
    BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CERT_VALIDITY, BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CERT_REFRESH
  - LEADER_ELECTION_*, METRICS_BIND_ADDRESS, METRICS_SECURE, HEALTH_PROBE_BIND_ADDRESS, WEBHOOK_PORT

  Example OLM Subscription override:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Subscription
  spec:
    config:
      env:
      - name: FEATURE_GATES
        value: "prometheusOperator,observability.metrics.createServiceMonitors"
      - name: TLS_PROFILE
        value: "Old"
  ```
