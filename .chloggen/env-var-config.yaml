  The operator now supports configuring feature gates and controller settings via environment variables.
  This enables OLM Subscription config overrides without modifying ConfigMaps.
  Environment variables take precedence over config file values.

  Boolean feature gates are configured via a single FEATURE_GATES environment variable with comma-separated values:
  - Format: "gate1,gate2,-gate3" where - prefix disables the gate
  - Available gates: openshift.route, openshift.servingCertsService, openshift.oauthProxy, httpEncryption,
    grpcEncryption, prometheusOperator, grafanaOperator, observability.metrics.createServiceMonitors,
    observability.metrics.createPrometheusRules, networkPolicies, builtInCertManagement

  Non-boolean settings use individual environment variables:
  - OPENSHIFT_BASE_DOMAIN, TLS_PROFILE, DEFAULT_POD_SECURITY_CONTEXT
  - BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CA_VALIDITY, BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CA_REFRESH,
    BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CERT_VALIDITY, BUILT_IN_CERT_MANAGEMENT_CERT_REFRESH

  Other supported environment variables: DISTRIBUTION, LEADER_ELECTION_*, METRICS_BIND_ADDRESS,
  METRICS_SECURE, HEALTH_PROBE_BIND_ADDRESS, WEBHOOK_PORT.

  Example OLM Subscription override:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Subscription
  spec:
    config:
      env:
      - name: FEATURE_GATES
        value: "prometheusOperator,observability.metrics.createServiceMonitors"
      - name: TLS_PROFILE
        value: "Old"
  ```
