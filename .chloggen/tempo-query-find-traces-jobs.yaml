  Following CRD options were added to speed up trace search in Jaeger UI/API. The trace search first
  searches for traceids and then it gets a full trace. With this configuration option the requests
  to get the full trace can be run in parallel:
  For `TempoStack` - `spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.findTracesConcurrentRequests`  
  For `TempoMonolithic` - `spec.jaegerui.findTracesConcurrentRequests`
