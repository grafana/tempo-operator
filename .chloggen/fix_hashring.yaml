  Adds support to configure the memberlist instance_addr field using the pod network IP range instead of the default private network range used. 
  In managed Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster environments as well as in special on-prem setup the private IP range might not be available for using them. 
  With this change set the TempoStack administrator can choose as a bind address the current pod network IP assigned by the cluster's pod network.
