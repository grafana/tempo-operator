  Ensure the permissions the operator is granting to the Tempo Service Account
  do not exceed the permissions of the user creating (or modifying) the Tempo instance
  when enabling OpenShift tenancy mode.

  To enable the OpenShift tenancy mode, the user must have permissions to create `TokenReview` and `SubjectAccessReview`.

  This breaking change does not affect existing Tempo instances in the cluster.
  However, the required permissions are now mandatory when creating or modifying a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic CR.
