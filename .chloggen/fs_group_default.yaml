  Certain CSI drivers (AWS EBS, DigitalOcean) mount volumes with root:root ownership and 755 permissions,
  causing permission denied errors when Tempo tries to write to /var/tempo/wal.
  The defaultPodSecurityContext feature flag controls whether the operator sets a default fsGroup (10001)
  for all pod security contexts when none is specified. This flag is enabled by default for community
  distribution and disabled for OpenShift (where SCCs manage the fsGroup automatically).
