  The operator now supports a configurable defaultPodSecurityContext in the feature gates.
  This allows setting default pod security context fields (fsGroup, runAsUser, etc.) that are
  merged into pod security contexts when specific fields are not set by the user.
  For Community distributions, fsGroup is set to 10001 to ensure volume permissions work correctly
  with certain CSI drivers (AWS EBS, DigitalOcean, etc.) that mount volumes with root:root ownership.
  For OpenShift, this is set to an empty object {} as SCCs manage security contexts automatically.
