  Introduces predefined deployment size profiles via the new `spec.size` field.
  Available sizes: `1x.demo`, `1x.pico`, `1x.extra-small`, `1x.small`, `1x.medium`.
  Each size maps to pre-tested resource configurations based on performance testing.
  Size also sets a default replication factor (1 for demo, 2 for others).
  Resource values are based on ingestion rates: extra-small (~100GB/day), small (~500GB/day), medium (~2TB/day).
