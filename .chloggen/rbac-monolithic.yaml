  This feature allows users to apply query RBAC in the multitenancy mode.
  The RBAC allows filtering span/resource/scope attributes and events based on the namespaces which a user querying the data can access.
  For instance, a user can only see attributes from namespaces it can access.
  
  ```yaml
  spec:
    query:
      rbac:
        enabled: true
  ```
