  When feature gate `openshift.clusterTLSPolicy` is enabled the TLS profile (min version and ciphers) are obtained from OpenShift APIServer CR.
  The feature gate `tlsProfile` can set the profile explicitly and is active only when `openshift.clusterTLSPolicy` is disabled.
  
  The TLS profile is then used in all TLS connections, however it can be overridden if (min version or ciphers) are directly specified in the TLS config
  for a given component in the CR.
  
  The `openshift.clusterTLSPolicy` can be enabled via `FEATURE_GATES` env variable
  The `tlsProfile` feature gate can be enabled via `TLS_PROFILE` environment variable and valid values are: `Old`, `Intermediate`, `Modern`.
  
  On OpenShift the `openshift.clusterTLSPolicy` is enabled by default.
