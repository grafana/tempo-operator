  On OpenShift when operator config `DistributorServingCertsService` is enabled and the following TempoStack CR is used.
  The operator provisions OpenShift serving certificates for the distributor ingest APIs
  ```
    apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
    kind:  TempoStack
    spec:
      template:
        distributor:
          tls:
            enabled: true
  ```
  No `certName` and `caName` should be provided, If you specify it, those will be used instead.

  In order to use this on the client side, the openshift CA certificate should be used, there are two ways of get
  access to it. You can mount the configmap generated by the operator, which will have the name `<tempostack-name>-serving-cabundle`
  Or you can access to it on `var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt`.
  
  An example of OTel configuration used:
  
  ```
     exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: tempo-simplest-distributor.chainsaw-tls-singletenant.svc.cluster.local:4317
        tls:
          insecure: false
          ca_file: "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt"
  ```
