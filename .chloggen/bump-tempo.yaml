  Upstream Tempo 2.5.0 image switched user from `root` to `tempo` (10001:10001) and ownership of `/var/tempo`.
  Therefore ingester's `/var/tempo/wal` created by previous deployment using Tempo 2.4.1 needs to be updated and
  changed ownership. The operator upgrades the `/var/tempo` ownership by deploying a `job` with `securityContext.runAsUser(0)`
  and it runs `chown -R /var/tempo 10001:10001`.
