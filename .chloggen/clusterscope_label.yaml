  Previously, when a non-multitenant TempoStack instance was created using the same name as an existing multitenant TempoStack instance, the operator erroneously deleted the Gateway ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding associated with the multitenant instance.

  With this change, cluster-scoped resources get an additional label `app.kubernetes.io/namespace` to signify the namespace of the TempoStack owning this cluster-scoped resource.
