This document tracks people and use cases for the Tempo Operator in production. By creating a list of production use cases we hope to build a community of advisors that we can reach out to with experience using various the Tempo Operator applications, operation environments, and cluster sizes. The Tempo Operator development team may reach out periodically to check-in on how the Tempo Operator is working in the field and update this list.
